## Software Development Reimagined

Being a 'Software Developer' isn't just about writing code.  As a developer, your job is to
bring your knowledge and expertise to the team and the product.  This requires collaboration, emergent leadership, communication,
and a willingness to work toward continued growth and understanding of development skills.

In this podcast with [Market Impact](https://www.marketimpactnow.com/), I talk about what it really means to be a software developer in our industry today.

### Description
As described be Dan Albaum, the host of the Market Impact Insights podcast on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danalbaum_podcast-market-impact-insights-activity-7239288636477751297-5bRS): 

_The human factor is alive and well in software development._  

_ðŸ’¡ The most meaningful innovation doesn't come from silos._  

_ðŸ‘‡ As shared in my latest Market Impact Insights podcast, collaborative programming has been a key enabler of faster decision-making and the pivots dynamic markets require for Technical Coaching Paige Watson._
