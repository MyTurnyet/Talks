## Deliberate Practice

Practice doesn't make perfect! ***Perfect* practice makes perfect**.

Professional athletes and musicians focus on practicing so that the quality of their work becomes
effortless. Why aren't you and your team practicing to get better?

Applying the concepts of Learned Behaviorism, using the techniques of Deliberate Practice, and simple "tools" like Code
Katas can result in a more knowledgeable team that produces higher-quality code at a more rapid pace.

In this talk, I lay out the concepts of Deliberate Practice and Learning-Performance Distinction. You'll learn how to
facilitate learning opportunities to ensure the best outcomes, and I'll give you examples of practices that I have
done (and continue to do) at companies that teach Deliberate Practice, and the positive outcomes achieved.
Attendees will participate in a simple, effective example of practices they can start with their teams immediately.

### Learning Outcomes

- Understand the concepts of Deliberate Practice and Learning-Performance Distinction.
- Learn how to practice with tools like Code Katas and Sparrow Decks effectively
- Understand the outcomes that learning as a group will bring to the team, and how to expand those outcomes to more than
  just developers.
