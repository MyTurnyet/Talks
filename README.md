### Current Bio
I recognize the importance of embracing 'Quality Software as Craft' principles.

Crafting software is a multifaceted challenge that demands exceptional talent to address not only problem-solving but also to ensure the software is designed for ease of maintenance and future growth. My experience includes guiding numerous teams in developing well-crafted software solutions and evolving their processes to become high-performing, scalable units.

I am dedicated to elevating developers into cohesive, high-performing teams capable of swiftly delivering top-tier software that meets the evolving needs of clients.

I am also an active speaker and educator, conducting workshops at various global corporations to share insights and strategies for excellence in software development.
