## Focus, Flow, and Cold Coffee: ADHD-Driven Development Practices

ADHD can feel like chaos — a mind racing with ideas, a desk full of half-drunk cold coffees, and a to-do list that’s
both overwhelming and strangely invisible. For years, I struggled to stay afloat as a developer, battling hyper-focus,
memory issues, and constant distraction. Then I discovered something surprising: the practices that help teams write
better code — like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Collaborative Programming**, and **Discovery Trees** — also helped me work with my
brain, not against it.

In this talk, I share how ADHD shaped my journey as a developer and how **quality coding practices became career-saving
coping mechanisms**. These tools helped me focus, manage complexity, and collaborate better — all while reducing burnout
and improving the code we shipped. Whether you live with ADHD or just want to work smarter in a world full of
distractions, you'll walk away with practical techniques and a fresh appreciation for how **neurodiversity can be a
powerful asset in tech**.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Understand how ADHD traits such as hyper-focus, memory challenges, and emotional sensitivity affect software
development** — and how these traits can be turned into strengths with supportive practices.
- **Learn how Test-Driven Development (TDD), Mob Programming, and Discovery Trees reduce cognitive load and enhance
productivity** — especially for neurodivergent developers.
- Discover practical strategies for creating a neurodiversity-friendly team culture that benefits everyone by promoting
structure, collaboration, and sustainable work habits.
